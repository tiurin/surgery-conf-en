# **Greeting**

Dear colleagues,

We are honored to invite you to take part in VII INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL CONFERENCE ON “MINIMAL IVNASIVE PEDIATRIC SURGERY & UROLOGY 2019” which will be held in Kyiv on September19-20 2019.

This event has important educational, scientific and social missions being focused on topical issues and modern tendencies of pediatric surgery and urology. Opinion Leaders from many countries are involved as speakers to this conference.   

“Live surgery” broadcasts will be included to the program of the conference. Participants will get an opportunity to attend “HOW I DO IT” workshop, dedicated to challenging and complicated surgical cases.

Little patients that will undergo surgical procedures within the conference are usually “social” kids, whose parents cannot afford treatment abroad; at the same time the experience of such operations in Ukraine is comparatively inconsiderable.

We hope sincerely that that being a participant of this meeting will be useful not only as a chance to gain some new knowledge and skills but also will offer a way to use them in your daily practice as pediatric surgeons and urologists.

Yours respectfully,
